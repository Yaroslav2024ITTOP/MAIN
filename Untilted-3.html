    <h1>HTML Tutorial</h1>
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    
    Hype rtext Markup Language (HJ.MU is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web
    applications.
    Web browsers receive J:UM.L documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
    into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
    included cues for the appearance of the document.
    HI.Mt elements are the building blocks of HIMJ .. pages. With HIM.~ constructs, images and other objects
    such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTMi,, provides a means to create
    structu red documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
    quotes and other items. HI.Ml elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
    <img /> and <input/> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and
    provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not
    display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
    <h2>Markup</h2>
    HTM~ markup consists of several key components, including those called lug!> (and thei1 utt,ilJllle!>),
    character-based data types, character references and entity references. HIM~ tags most commonly come in
    pai1 s like <h1 > and </h1 >, although some I epr esent empty elements and so aI e unpai,ed, fo1 example
    <img> . The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening
    togs and closing tags).
    Another important component is the J:tIM~ document type declaration, which triggers standards mode
    rendering.
    The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
    < I OOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>This is a title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <p>Hello world I </p>
    </body>
    </html>
