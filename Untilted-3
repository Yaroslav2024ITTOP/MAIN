    <h1>HTML Tutorial</h1>
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>

    <b>Hypertext Markup Language (<span>HTML</span>)</b> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.

    Web browsers receive <span>HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
    <span>HTML</span> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
    
    <span>HTML</span> elements are the building blocks of <span>HTML</span> pages. With <span>HTML</span> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
    <span>HTML</span> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
    <span>HTML</span> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
    Tags such as &#60img /&#62 and &#60input /&#62 directly introduce content into the page. 
    Other tags such as &#60p&#62 surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. 
    Browsers do not display the <span>HTML</span> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
    
    <h2>Markup</h2>
    
    <span>HTML</span> markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. 
    <span>HTML</span> tags most commonly come in pairs like &#60h1&#62 and &#60/h1&#62, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>. 
    The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
    Another important component is the <span>HTML</span> document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.
    
    The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
    
    <p>&#60!DOCTYPE html&#62</p>
    <p>&#60html&#62</p>
    <p>&#60head&#62</p>
    <p>&#60title&#62This is a title&#60/title&#62</p>
    <p>&#60/head&#62</p>
    <p>&#60body&#62</p>
    <p>&#60p&#62Hello world!&#60/p&#62</p>
    <p>&#60/body&#62</p>
    <p>&#60/html&#62</p>
